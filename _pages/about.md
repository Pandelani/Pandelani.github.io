Hi' I am Pandelani, some people call me Panda, thanks for visiting my playzone. I am a Data Scientist by profession with keen interest in Forest Tree Breeding and all things machine learning. I was trained at various institutions of higher learning and I am a believer of the word of the Lord.

My work is on the application of artificial intelligence techniques in forest tree breeding. I have long focused on model validation and governance for a big bank in South Africa, but i also have a keen interest in Financial Crime modelling and Football analytics. Reach out to me if you wanna collaborate or go through some of my papers on modelling forest trees or applycing machine learning techniques to healthcare problems.

The Tshipise Sagole Baobab Tree
======
What would be a story without a mention of the Tshipise Sagole Baobab tree?.  My colleagues always accuse me of overhyping my village and trinbesmen, I blame all of this to my childhood upbringing. Tshipise is a remote village in the Vhembe District, blessed with a hot water spring, and many other nature attraction places. Happy to show you around and visit the Kruger National Park through the Pafuri Gate.
